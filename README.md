EXPOSURE is a stealth-exploration game set in a Film Noir setting. In it you play Jack, a hard-boiled private investigator whose latest case has him ensnared in a labyrinth of mystery, deceit, and incriminating photographs. Armed with your camera and your investigative skills, it is now up to you to get your hands dirty to expose this filth to the public.

As *Richard Campbell* describes it: "It's Metal Gear Solid meets Pokémon Snap!, and bears no resemblance whatsoever to Dear Esther."
